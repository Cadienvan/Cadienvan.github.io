## Leadership advice is everywhere, but.
Threads, books, courses, TED talks, frameworks, pyramids, quadrants, canvases, principles, checklists.

But after years of being a Developer / Tech Lead / Manager / everything in between, here's the uncomfortable punchline I keep coming back to:

> 95% of leadership wisdom can be reduced to one brutal sentence:  
> "Thanks Captain Obvious - just don't be an asshole."

And sure, it sounds superficial... until you look closely and realize how many people fail at exactly this.

We read articles about psychological safety while publicly mocking colleagues' ideas.  
We repost quotes about empowerment and then micromanage code reviews.  
We celebrate team ownership while hoarding decisions.

The problem isn't knowledge.  
It's interest.  
It's empathy.  
It's the willingness to see the human being behind the ticket, the PR, the meeting request.

And I'm not innocent either.  
I'm writing this while replaying a highlight reel of all the times I failed people - the times I interrupted, dismissed, rushed to solutions, hid behind architecture, or simply didn't listen. I still regret some of those moments. And I know the next mistake is just around the corner, waiting to teach me something else about myself.

But maybe that's the point:  
Leadership is not about perfection.  
It's about noticing when you screwed up - and choosing to do better next time.

## The Ridiculous Obviousness Behind Leadership Advice.

Let's take a tour of some universally celebrated principles and translate them into plain English.

> Empower your team.

➡️ Let people do their job.  
Stop solving everything for them. Stop being the human bottleneck.

I already wrote this in [Authority and Accountability](/blog/en/authority-and-accountability/), where authority goes down but accountability goes up. A concept so simple it should be stapled above every manager's monitor.

> Practice active listening.

➡️ Shut up. They're talking.  
You don't need a workshop for this. You need self-awareness.

> Create psychological safety.

➡️ Don't make people feel stupid.  
If you roll your eyes at a question, congratulations - you just became the problem.

> Lead by example.

➡️ Do the things you expect others to do.  
I already wrote this clearly in [Build a Rocket with LEGOs](/blog/en/build-a-rocket-with-legos/): great developers - and great leaders - make complexity disappear instead of showing off with it.

> Avoid over-engineering / stay pragmatic.

➡️ Solve the real problem, not the one inside your head.  
I already wrote this in [What Sits and What Fits](/blog/en/what-sits-and-what-fits/) and expanded it in [Stay in the Problem Space](/blog/en/stay-in-the-problem-space/): clarity beats cleverness, always.

> Help the team grow.

➡️ Care enough to invest in people.  
If you don't genuinely want them to succeed, they will feel it. Immediately.

## Leadership Isn't Learned - It's Revealed.

After years of reading, practicing, and messing up, here's the truth I can't unsee:

Leadership doesn't come from frameworks.  
It comes from how you see - and treat - people.

You can read 200 leadership books.  
You can memorize every model.  
You can preach every principle on LinkedIn.

But if you don't fundamentally care about:  
what your teammates fear,  
what they hope,  
what drains them,  
what motivates them,  
what they need from you...

...then none of it matters.

Leadership is not a skillset you can copy-paste.  
It's a lens.  
A way of perceiving humans before processes.  
A willingness to adapt yourself before asking others to adapt to you.

And most importantly:

You cannot lead people you are not willing to understand.

This is the foundation underneath all the "obvious" advice - the part books rarely emphasize, because you can't teach someone to care.

## Some Real Examples (a Bit Too Real).
### When someone delivers poor work

Bad leader:  
> Ugh, they're not good enough.

Actual leader:  
> Did I communicate poorly? Is the context unclear? Are they overwhelmed?

### When a junior makes a mistake

Bad leader:  
> "We can't afford this."

Actual leader:  
> "Mistakes are tuition. Let's look at it together."

### When the team is drowning

Bad leader:  
> "Push harder."

Actual leader:  
> "What can we remove? Who needs support? What am I missing?"


And yes - I've been both versions.
Sometimes in the same week.

## The Ironic Twist.

All the leadership lessons we admire - empathy, clarity, autonomy, pragmatism, communication - are the same things we celebrate in great developers.

If you read my previous articles, you'll notice a pattern:
- [The Truth About Test Coverage](/blog/en/the-truth-about-test-coverage/) -> clarity beats vanity metrics.
- [Iterative Contract Testing](/blog/en/iterative-contract-testing/) -> simplicity beats complexity.
- [Colleague-Based Testing](/blog/en/colleague-based-testing/) -> your code must be understandable to others.
- [Asynchronous Batching](/blog/en/asynchronous-batching/) -> optimize for collective efficiency.

Replace "codebase" with "team", and they just became leadership mantras.

Turns out the line between a good architect and a good leader is thinner than we think.

## Conclusion.

I've made enough mistakes to fill a trilogy.  
I'll make more.  
You will too.

But if there's one thing I've learned - one thing no article, no podcast, no book ever taught me explicitly - it's this:

The quality of your leadership is measured in how people feel after interacting with you.  
Not how much they admire you - but how safe, capable, and seen they feel.

So go ahead: keep reading leadership books if you enjoy them.  
But remember that the real work happens the moment you close them -  
when a teammate hesitates before speaking,  
when someone silently struggles,  
when a PR arrives with hidden insecurity behind every commit.

That's where leadership begins.  
And that's where the motto hits hardest.

Just don't be an asshole.  
Everything else is optional.
